# FreeCodeCamp-ResponsiveWeb
These are all the projects I worked on while learning FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course

This project is a Tribute Page. 
I creates a person to for this project and created dummy information on the person. From information about their 
social media accounts to their hobbies.
