                        with a Bachelor's in Jounralism and Computer Science. During her time at USC, she was an web editor/photographer for the on-campus 
                        newspaper. Creating content and sharing to the masses sparked her interest in Jounralism, and with the growth of 
                        technology Joanna decide to enroll into her first coding class.

                            Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives. You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Travelling is a hobby like any other.

                            Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another can be categorized together with fun activities like watching movies, swimming, dancing or drawing. While it has more challenges than other hobbies, it is more adventurous and brings the same level of satisfaction or more for those who love it.

                            Travelling has always been part of our family tradition. My parents taught us from an early age the value of taking vacations at least once a year. Though they wished we could go for many trips annually, we were not well off financially and my parents had to work creatively with the little they had, sometimes saving the whole year for a single trip. We could have used credit cards, but that would have only plunged us into more financial woes. My father was very strict when it came to finances and he cautioned us against using debt to purchase luxuries. If we wanted something, then it was up to us to find creative and legal ways of making money to purchase it.
